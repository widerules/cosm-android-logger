The app logs CPU usage, available memory, data usage (transmitted and received Kb) and battery level. When you start the app it asks for a Cosm Feed ID and a key (with update and create permissions). Users can also configure what resources will be logges and how often the feed will be updated (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours).
The CPU usage and available memory are polled every 10 seconds and a total average is calculated and used for updating the feed.
